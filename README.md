# Find Your Favorite Dinner Character

## Overview

"Find Your Favorite Dinner Character" is a React-based application developed by Tshiamo Tsoku. The application utilizes CSS, JavaScript, and HTML through the React framework. It integrates data from the external Disney API provided by [DisneyAPI](https://disneyapi.dev) to fetch and display information about Disney characters.

## Project Details

**Author:** Tshiamo Tsoku  
**GitHub Repository:** [Find Your Favorite Dinner Character](https://github.com/itsjustyamo/ReactProject/tree/main)

**Description:** This application aims to provide users with a fun and interactive way to explore Disney characters while discovering their favorite dinner recipes. Users can browse through a list of Disney characters, view their images and descriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used for styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal of the application.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used for implementing interactive features and dynamic behavior within the application.
  
- **React:** React is the JavaScript library used for building the user interface components and managing the application's state.

## Challenges

The main challenges encountered during the development of this application were:

1. **Uncommenting the Characters Component:** Integrating the characters component seamlessly into the application required troubleshooting and understanding the React component structure.
  
2. **Attaching the "More Details" Page:** Implementing a detailed page for each character required careful routing and state management within the React application.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, several improvements could be made to enhance the application:

- **Visual Appeal:** Enhance the user interface to make it more visually appealing and engaging.
  
- **Accuracy:** Refine the data retrieval process from the Disney API to ensure accuracy and completeness of character information.
  
- **Additional Features:** Implement additional features such as sorting characters by attributes, adding favorite character functionality, or integrating more APIs for diverse content.
